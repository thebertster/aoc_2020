## (<http://adventofcode.com/2020/>)

Using Python. Aiming for pylint score of 10.0 for each day against the Google Python style guide.

Trying to avoid using any existing libraries (even simple ones like 'collections' etc.) - will
make an exception for painful things like trigonometry and date/time manipulation though!

This also means no dirty use of evals and execs!

Aiming for a run time of < 15 seconds.
